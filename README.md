# Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging
Parts of speech tagging simply refers to assigning parts of speech to individual words in a sentence, which means that, unlike phrase matching, which is performed at the sentence or multi-word level, parts of speech tagging is performed at the token level. POS tags (noun, verb, adjective) and fine-grained tags (plural noun, past-tense verb, superlative adjective).

# Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition refers to the identification of words in a sentence as an entity e.g. the name of a person, place, organization, etc.
